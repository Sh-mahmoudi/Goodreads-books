# Goodreads-books

This project explores a dataset of books to perform analysis using various data science techniques.

Data Source: [Kaggle â€“ Goodreads Books](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jealousleopard/goodreadsbooks)

The Jupyter notebook `book.ipynb` contains all steps for data loading, cleaning, and exploration.

The dataset includes features such as:  
`title`, `author`, `publisher`, `ratings`, `genres`, `year`, and more.

This notebook mainly focuses on descriptive analysis. Distributions of various features are visualized. A weighted rating formula is also calculated to identify books with high popularity and quality. Additionally, the most popular books are determined based on different features.
